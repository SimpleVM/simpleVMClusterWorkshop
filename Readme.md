# SimpleVM Workshop

This workshop demonstrates a typical workflow of a SimpleVM user.
In this workshop your goal will be to identify pathogenic bacteria
that were classified as "greatest threat to human health" by the 
World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2017: https://www.who.int/news/item/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed

In the SimpleVM Introduction session samples based on the Mash Screen result were selected.
You will now analyze the selected samples using the Metagenomics-Toolkit.
For that reason you will start a SimpleVM Cluster. 

### Section 5: Scale up your analysis horizontally to further analyze the detected Microbiomes

In this part you will use a SimpleVM Cluster to distribute your analysis 
on multiple machines instead of just one. You will use the Metagenomics-Toolkit to analyze the detected Microbiomes.
